Hi Sir,

Here are my updates sir:

f) translators may access translation-table. And only this. For r/w, but not delete (as we had it). -->> DONE

user_r may see everything, except admin-areas (is reduced standard now) -->> DONE

user_w may see and write everything, except admin-areas (is standard now) -->> DONE

admin: may see and write everything, as is standard for admin now. -->> DONE

event_reservations: providers with this set to on, can use the events-reservations. Others can not.
but do not suppress the switch, just leave it not operational and add a helptext there: “if you want to use reservations, you need to upgrade your plan” – with a link to a new “plan”-page, which can be empty for the moment, except with a helptext. Point me, where i can edit this in the database.
set this in the moment to standard=1 / on for everybody and also as standard for new created records.
in order to switch this off or on, one has to open the “plan”-page as well, offer a link there. -->> DONE

event_bookholding: will be 0 in the moment for all users, set this in the standard of a new record as well. . We will add later functionality, so they can print an overview over the participants of selected events or selected timeframes.

session_reservations: set this to 1 for everybody and also to the newly created records. --->> DONE

session_bookholding: set this to 0 for everybody and also for newly created records. --->> DONE

we will create code and management to make bookholding for all sessions with overviews who booked, cancelled or rescheduled late and so forth. 

Please let me know sir your feedback. Let me know also if this is enough to request the balance payment for this.

thanks,
Ken
