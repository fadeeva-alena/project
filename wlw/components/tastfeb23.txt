1)      Menu straightening in admin-section (unify 2, move other)

2)      Login does not work in safari

3)      Small glitch with this:  (see letter after pia marz…)

4) add checkbox right of leader 1: not mentioned, drop the need for at least one leader.
5) When entering multiple dates, offer the user in the new line the calendar with the last date selected, 
so, for example, if they enter date 4, suggest date 3 in the calendar.

reason: if they start in january, and enter one date a month, they have to scroll once one month first.
Then twice on entering next date, then 3x for the next date and so forth.
If this is implemented, they will always just scroll once.

2..5 is worth 35$
