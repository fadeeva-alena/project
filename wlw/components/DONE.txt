-----------------------
b) thanks- designer will have to rework thi s one too.. it was meant to increase the contrast btw logo and background.. but i dont see a difference.
e) thanks .. i cant check.. showing the last page / next from page 1/ in translation-grid loops endlessly. please check. --->>> DONE
helptext opera: please check again. i dont see a difference. --->> DONE, please refresh the page.
f) 2 scrollbars: fine, except on leader_grid. also on leadergrid: please swith th titles of the columns as well, right now you have image" on top of the numbers. ---->>> DONE

to keep the sortoptions would be very helpful - at least while a record is edited and saved or added and saved. how can you do that? --->>> i can't customize the plugins of flexigrid sir. I only used that but the retaining the sorting in the grid will not be possible here sir.

Pictures drag and drop: ok. how can you make it possible? --->>> don't know it, I will search for this but not sure about this.

h) pictures size: i dont see a difference. please check this again. need this in all grids.
sorting is weired: i get this sequence: 7,7,19,12,23, 20, 18,16.. this is not up nor down sorted. please sort falling, biggest first.--->> DONE, i checked it on ff, chrome, opera and it is working.

and this also persists: when you open providers_grid, you see my profile manytimes - this is not wrong, i have mrdavid_i, mrdavid_f and so forth. but what i know for sure, that i do not have the same amount of events entered on each account..  also stephan maurer has a count of 0. his count is around 800, actually. ---->>>> DONE

m) dont see a difference. please check. --->>> DONE
